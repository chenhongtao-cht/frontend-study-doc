## 题目

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the
beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer `x`: Record a new score of `x`.
- `'+'`: Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- `'D'`: Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- `'C'`: Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return _the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations_.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a **32-bit** integer and that all operations are valid.

**Example 1:**

> Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
>
> Output: 30
>
> Explanation:
>
> "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
>
> "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
>
> "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
>
> "D" - Add 2 \* 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
>
> "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
>
> The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

**Example 2:**

> Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
>
> Output: 27
>
> Explanation:
>
> "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
>
> "-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
>
> "4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
>
> "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
>
> "D" - Add 2 \* -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
>
> "9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
>
> "+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
>
> "+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
>
> The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.

**Example 3:**

> Input: ops = ["1","C"]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation:
>
> "1" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].
>
> "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].
>
> Since the record is empty, the total sum is 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= operations.length <= 1000`
- `operations[i]` is `"C"`, `"D"`, `"+"`, or a string representing an integer in the range `[-3 * 10^4, 3 * 10^4]`.
- For operation `"+"`, there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
- For operations `"C"` and `"D"`, there will always be at least one previous score on the record.

## 题目大意

这道题是模拟题，给一串数字和操作符。出现数字就直接累加，出现 `"C"` 就代表栈推出一个元素，相应的总和要减去栈顶的元素。出现 `"D"` 就代表把前一个元素乘以 `2`，就得到当前的元素值，再累加。出现 `"+"` 就代表把前 `2` 个值求和，得到当前元素的值，再累积。

## 解题思路

这道题用栈模拟即可。

## 代码

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var calPoints = function (operations) {
  let stack = [];
  for (item of operations) {
    let top = stack.length - 1;
    switch (item) {
      case "+":
        stack.push(stack[top] + stack[top - 1]);
        break;
      case "C":
        stack.pop();
        break;
      case "D":
        stack.push(stack[top] * 2);
        break;
      default:
        stack.push(Number(item));
        break;
    }
  }
  return stack.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
};
```
